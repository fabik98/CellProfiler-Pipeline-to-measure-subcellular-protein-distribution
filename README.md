Here, we provide a detailed protocol to quantify cytochrome c release including all experimental steps and usage of our established CellProfiler segmentation and analysis pipeline. Importantly, this method is not restricted to the analysis of cytochrome c release. In principle, any protein detectable by immunofluorescence staining can be quantitatively assessed within any subcellular compartment, where an appropriate reference marker is available for compartmental segmentation.
